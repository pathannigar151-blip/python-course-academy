# **README**

* This repo is for the **Streebo Academy Python Course** by instructor **[Utkarsh Tiwari](https://utkarsh-tiwari-dev.vercel.app/)**.

* It is used to **track and practice all Python problems** taught in the course.

* Each folder contains topic-wise problem files written only as comments. Read the comments and write your solution below them.

* To start: **clone the repo**

  ```
  git clone <repo-link>
  ```

  Then open the folder in VS Code or any code editor.

* After writing your solutions, **commit and push your changes**:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "added solutions"
  git push
  ```

* Do **not** delete or rename existing folders. Always add solutions inside the correct topic folder.

* Students must **keep adding new problems and solutions in the same style** as the course continues so that everyone stays in sync.

* You may add your own extra practice questions too, but maintain the same folder structure.
